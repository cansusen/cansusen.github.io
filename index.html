				I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. My advisor is Prof. Elke Rundensteiner, and I am a member of the Data Science Research Group (DSRG). My research focuses on Machine Learning, Data Mining, and their applications to healthcare. Currently, I am working on deep learning models with attention mechanisms to predict healthcare-associated infections using clinical time series and text data. I received my M.Sc. degree from Koc University, Turkey, in 2015, and my BS degree from Yildiz Technical University, Turkey, in 2010, both in Computer Science and Engineering. Throughout my master's studies, I worked as a research assistant at Koc University Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI) Lab. Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as a software engineer in the banking sector for three years.
